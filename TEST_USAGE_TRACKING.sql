-- ðŸ§ª TEST USAGE TRACKING
-- This script tests the usage tracking system to ensure it's working properly

-- Step 1: Check current usage for all users
SELECT 
    'Current Usage Status' as test_type,
    p.email,
    p.current_plan,
    ut.month_year,
    ut.documents_uploaded,

FROM public.profiles p
JOIN public.usage_tracking ut ON p.id = ut.user_id
WHERE ut.month_year = TO_CHAR(NOW(), 'YYYY-MM')
ORDER BY ut.documents_uploaded DESC;

-- Step 2: Manually increment usage for testing (replace 'your-email@example.com' with your actual email)
-- This simulates what happens when you perform actions
UPDATE public.usage_tracking

    SELECT id FROM public.profiles 
    WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com' -- REPLACE WITH YOUR EMAIL
)

-- Step 3: Check if the update worked
SELECT

-- Step 4: Test the view
