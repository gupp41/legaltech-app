-- RESTORE_DOCUMENTS.sql
-- This script will help restore documents by checking storage and recreating records

-- First, let's see what's currently in the database
SELECT 'Current state - documents table:' as info;
SELECT COUNT(*) as document_count FROM documents WHERE user_id = 'db4e910a-2771-4fdc-b3a1-0aa85d414d79';

-- Check if there are any documents at all
SELECT 'Total documents in database:' as info;
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_documents FROM documents;

-- If documents were deleted, we need to check what's in storage
-- and potentially restore them. But first, let's see the current state.

-- Check if there are any orphaned records that might have been created
-- during the sync process
SELECT 'Checking for any remaining data:' as info;
SELECT * FROM documents LIMIT 5;

-- If the documents table is empty, we'll need to restore from storage
-- This would require checking the storage bucket and recreating records
-- But first, let's see what the current state is.
